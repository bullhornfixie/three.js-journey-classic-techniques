# Three.js Journey

## Key Learning Points 
- How to cast a Ray in a scene
- A ray is a line with an endpoint and goes indefinitely in one direction 
- Three has a Raycast Class `new THREE.Raycaster()`
- It requires an `origin` and `direction` which can be achieved by using `Vector3 class`
- Three has a Gridhelper Class `new THREE.GridHelper(9, 9)`
