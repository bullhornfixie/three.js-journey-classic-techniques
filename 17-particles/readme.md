# 17 Particles 

## Key Learning Points 
- Custom geometry using `BufferGeometry()`
- `alphaTest` value between 0 and 1, enables WebGL to know when not to render the pixel - default the value is 0. 
- `additiveBlending` color of two objects are added to each other - e.g. becomes brighter 

### Creating Random Colors 
- A color is composed of RGB
- Using a `for loop` to create random colors 
- R has a range of 0-1
- G has a range of 0-1
- B has a range of 0-1
- When each element has a different range, it creates a different color
