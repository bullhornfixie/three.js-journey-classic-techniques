# 15 Shadows

## Key Learning Points 
- Now we have lights, we want shadows 
- Back of the objects are in the dark - called `core shadow`
- `drop shadow` is where objects create shadows on the other objects 
- THREE has a built in solution but it's far from perfect 
- ShadowMap Algorithm 
- Baking shadows
- Z fighting when two planes are at same position 

### Built In Shadow Maps 
- `THREE.BasicShadowMap` 
- `THREE.PCFShadowMap` 
- `THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap` 
- `THREE.VSMShadowMap`
- Add to renderer
